![A triangulated random graph](/assets/images/triangulering.png)

Hi! I'm Anna, a PhD student in computational mathematics at Stockholm University. My scientific interests can briefly be summarized as:
<blockquote> Graph theory and other discrete structures with an algorithmic focus; often motivated by genetic data and the study of evolution .</blockquote> This is my online-CV, a list of my written works

#### I'm currently thinking about

* Efficient algorithms on graphs guided by modular decomposition trees
* What information of a rooted network can be recovered from information concerning the leaves only (least common ancestors, common descendants, etc...)
