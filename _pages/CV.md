## Employment history

**2024--** Teaching Assistant (TA) as PhD student\
I am currently a TA with a coordinating role in two courses (DA4005
Algorithms and complexity and DA4006 Datastructures and algorithms). I
present solutions to problems and grade written hand-ins, occasionally
including code. In 2024, I additionally held four lectures covering
topics on greedy algorithms, dynamic programming and graph theory.
See the page [Teaching]({% link _pages/teaching.md %}) for more information.

**2020--2023** Teaching Assistant as Bachelor's and Master's student\
Alongside my studies, I was involved as a TA in multiple courses at
Stockholm University. I have, for example, presented problem solutions,
answered students' questions and corrected exams, labs and hand-ins.

**Fall 2022** Teaching Assistant at Linköping University\
After moving to Linköping in Sweden, I additionally worked part-time at
Linköping University. There I held short lessons, corrected exams and
answered questions -- rather similar to what I did as a TA at Stockholm
University. In Linköping I was involved in an introductory mathematics
course and a course in linear algebra, both given to first-year
engineering students.

**2016--2018** Order Processor at ALNO Scandinavia, Stockholm\
I was involved in various administrative tasks at this high-end kitchen
retailer.
