# Teaching

In the following table, you will find a full breakdown of courses I've taught in.
All courses are at Bachelor's level given at Stockholm University, except where indicated.
I worked approximately 660
hours with teaching at SU during 2020--2023, and around 280 hours at LiU in 2022.
Teaching as part of my PhD position constitutes 20% full-time or,
approximately, 400 hours per year.
